# FILE-INTEGRITY-MONITORING-USING-WAZUH

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using the open-source security platform Wazuh on an Ubuntu-based environment.
The objective of this project is to detect, monitor, and alert unauthorized changes in critical system files in real-time. This is a core capability of Security Operations Center (SOC) environments and is essential for detecting insider threats, malware activity, and unauthorized access.
Objectives

Implement File Integrity Monitoring using Wazuh
Monitor critical system directories (e.g., /etc, /var, /home)
Detect file creation, deletion, and modification
Generate real-time security alerts
Analyze alerts via Wazuh Dashboard
Understand how FIM helps in incident detection and forensic investigation

What is File Integrity Monitoring?
File Integrity Monitoring is a security process that:
1.Compares current file metadata to a trusted baseline
2.Detects unauthorized changes to files and directories
3.Helps identify security breaches or policy violations
FIM is commonly used in enterprise environments and is required by compliance standards such as ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS.
